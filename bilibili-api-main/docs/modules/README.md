**NOTE: All the files are auto generated by `doc_gen.py`**

To update the docs, run `python3 scripts/doc_gen.py`. `mypy` (`stubgen`) required.

**NOTE: `doc_gen` generate the docs based on the `docstring` in the py code in `/bilibili_api`, be sure to modify the `docstring`.**

If there's anything fault during generating documentation, please **modify the `docstring` instead of changing `doc_gen.py` (shit code warning)**.
